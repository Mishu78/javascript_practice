//"I will invest at least 6 hrs every single day for next 60 days!" this message 60 times. So display this using for loop.

for(let i=1;i<=60;i++){
    console.log(i,"I will invest at least 6 hrs every single day for next 60 days!");
}

let n=1;
while(n<=60){
    console.log(n,"I will invest at least 6 hrs every single day for next 60 days!");
    n++;
}
